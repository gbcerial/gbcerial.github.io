                <h2>Welcome to Desolve <br></h2>
                <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of <b>design</b> and <b>evolve</b>, something we hope<br>
                    we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who<br>
                    enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also<br>
                    occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography.<br></p>

                <h2>So... what aren't we?</h2>
                <p>Professional photographers, for one- Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers- We submit these<br>
                    galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what<br>
                    lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate, we'd love to have you. All<br>
                    galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us<br>
                    what you have in mind.<br></p>
                <p>We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'll let everyone know and schedule <br>
                    a meet up day to tour the city and take photos- If you'd like us to visit your city, <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid" style="color:orange;">let us know!</abbr></p>

                <h2>Photographers rights</h2>
                <p>Due to the heightened security concerns around the
                    country, it has become common to find photographers
                    routinely challenged when taking photograpns in public
                    places. With that in mind. we invite you to join us in a tree
                    forum as noted photographer Shea Hansen presents
                    "Photographers Rights in a post 9/11 World" <br>
                </p>
                <p>Shea will discuss what your nghts are when taking
                    Photos in a public space. Following her talk we'll have an
                    open forum where you can ask questions, compare
                    experiences. and become better jnrorme•d as to wnat
                    your responsibilities are as amateur photographers.<br></p>
